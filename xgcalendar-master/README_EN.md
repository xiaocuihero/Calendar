####Loading Params
 **request data sample**
>showdate=2013-1-9&viewtype=month&timezone=8

Showdate is the current date, viewtype is the current view, timezone is the time zone.
The server must compute the start date and end date, from the given showdate, viewtype and time zone offset. Then it must retrieve the events and encode them.


**response data sample**

>{"events":[],"issort":true,"start":"\/Date(1261353600000)\/","end":"\/Date(1261958399000)\/","error":null}

`events`: Data format is identical to `eventItems`.
`issort`: Whether are sorted (please do that on the server side).
`start` and `end`: Current view date range, json date format.
`error`: An exception object can be generated by the server. Format is `{ErrorCode:””,ErrorMsg:””}`. It is handled by `onRequestDataError`.

####Updating Params
**request data sample**
>calendarId=98&CalendarStartTime=2013-1-2+00%3A00&CalendarEndTime=2013-1-2+00%3A00&timezone=8
Date and time is formated according to your multi-language configuration choice.

**response data sample**
> {"IsSuccess":true,"Msg":""}

Error message when success and failure.

This is used on event deletetion and addition. If you want, you can look through the tools: Chrome use F12 to bring up the developer tools, switch the Network tab, you can see the operation.


##FAQ

* There is no java demo version
> No, I know. You are very welcome to contribute, if you want to provide one.

* How to control the time range 8:00 to 18:00 pm (similar to the control period)?
> xgcalendar does not provide such functionality. If you are willing to pay me, I'll consider helping you achieve that.

* Pop-up layer by clicking on the event can not get the focus, text can not be selected, and so on.
> This is probably because I disabled the bubble pop layers mousedown events, new input box can be obtained by clicking on the focus.
> In the code with the following piece of code pop-up layer:
> `buddle.mousedown (function (e) {return false})`
> `$(document).one("mousedown", function(){})`
> The main problem is this event. You can comment out the mousedown event above. Then click to determine whether the position inside the buddle. You can evaluation position, or eventtarget child element .

* I would like to add a new layer in the pop field. How to do it?
> First you have to add the corresponding input or select tags in html pop-layer;
> Second, in the code treating assignment to the value of this element, insert into the request parameters in the post, but also stored in the local cache.
> The last may have to modify some small flaws, depending on your test case. Although someone else once realize this, it was a long time ago, and I can not remember the whole process.

* What is xgcalendar copyright? Does it cost anything? Can it be used for commercial projects?
> Xgcalendar is an open source project. You can use it in a commercial project, free of charge; I only ask that you keep the copyright information. If you want me do do some custom development, then I may charge some fees, depending on the functional complexity of what you need.

* What about wdcalendar? This program is very similar to your xgcalendar?
> I found out it is indeed, or a Frenchman told me. wdcalendar is a complete copy of xgcalendar, but for the comments that were translated in English. I strongly despise such behavior, copying my plugins and pretend it's one's work. [http://www.web-delicious.com/jquery-plugins/](http://www.web-delicious.com/jquery-plugins/ "in this list"). That site is a pirate site, with no credit to my work. Common, guys...

* How to add Lunar calendar?
> Lunar calendar data can be generated on the server side, and then displayed on the client.
